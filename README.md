# HubSpot extension for Sourcegraph

A [Sourcegraph extension](https://docs.sourcegraph.com/extensions) that enhances GitHub with:

- link previews that show the HubSpot customer name (wherever a HubSpot customer URL is mentioned in GitHub issues or pull requests)
- autocompletion in text areas for HubSpot customer names (to the HubSpot customer URL), similar to GitHub's builtin autocompletion for GitHub issues and users

**Status:** WIP
